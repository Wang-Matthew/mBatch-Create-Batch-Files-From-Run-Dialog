# mBatch-Create-Batch-Files-From-Run-Dialog
Create a batch file quickly and automatically straight from the run dialog. 

I realized I was often making a lot of batch files to run my programs straight from the run dialog. I thought to myself, what better way to "automate the boring stuff" than to automate the process of making batch files? This program can quickly create a new .bat file for you to run your .py programs from the run dialog. 

Instructions: 

Save both mBatch.py and mBatch.bat to wherever you put your other Python programs. 

In mBatch.py you will have to change "C:\\PathOfWhereverYouPutYourPythonFiles\\" to the actual pathing of wherever you put your python scripts

In mBatch.bat you will have to change "C:\PathOfWhereverYouPutmBatch.py\" to the actual pathing of wherever you put mBatch.py 

Click windows button + R to open the run dialog, then type "mBatch + (name of the file you want create a batch for).py" and it'll run and create a new batch file wherever you set the pathing for it. 

For example, if I wanted to create a batch file for a .py program called "mapitprogram.py" I would hit windows + R and then type "mBatch mapitprogram.py" into the run dialog. 

Hope this helps!

Best,

Matt
